            At ZeroBite, we believe that every ingredient has a purpose and no food should go to waste. Our platform empowers users to make the most of what they already have by generating smart, tasty recipes using leftover ingredients. Whether it’s a half onion, some cooked rice, or overripe bananas — we help you turn them into something delicious.

            But our mission goes beyond the kitchen. ZeroBite also connects users with verified food donation centers, enabling them to share excess food with those in need. By combining smart cooking with social impact, we aim to build a more sustainable and compassionate food system — one bite at a time.
